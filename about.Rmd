My name is Joseph Severs and I am currently in my Junior year at Appalachain State. I transferred here from North Greenville University of South Carolina. Growing up in High Point, North Carolina, Soccer became my passion and I decided to pursue a degree and play at the highest level. I am currently studying Secondary Math Education. I played college soccer for two years at North Greenville University before transferring to Appalachian State. I plan to graduate in May 2020 and teach highschool math, along with coach soccer either at the highschool or club level.
